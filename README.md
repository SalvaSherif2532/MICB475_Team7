#### [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### February 6, 2025 Agenda
* Review studies identified as usable
* Nail down the broad questions we would potentially like to explore and ask
* Set goals for proposal formulation and main analyses we would like to conduct
* Determine the distribution of tasks going forward as well as a rough timeline
* Should we look for more studies for influenza in humans?

  * Is there value in considering a parallel analysis with the mouse data we have managed to potentially identify?
  * Is there any value in looking for more datasets with different diseases?

### January 30, 2025 Minutes  
Going forward please use github repository  
Make sure we put team agenda & meeting minutes in a read me file on the repository  
Night before each meeting try to put on the agenda:  
1. What you’ve worked on this past week
2. Any questions we have for Bessie


Ideas:  
COVID in comparison to other respiratory illnesses (mostly looking at gut microbiome)  
Try to find datasets from similar regions  
Try to find 5-10 resp disease datasets   
Note: try to pick pre-vaccination or post-vaccination  
Try to keep the model the same (either mouse or humanized mouse)  
* NOTE: if not going to compare different resp diseases, do a machine learning portion on COVID to create a predictive model  
  
Zoo animals vs wild animals & weaning age  
Try to find one more to increase in numbers 


Caveats:
We have to do a lot of research into the background to understand what’s going on
N numbers is pretty little
Oral microbiome related to disease?
